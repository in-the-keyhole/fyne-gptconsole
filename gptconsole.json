[{"Context":"Java","Prompt":"Hello World Example","Response":"Here is an example of a basic Java program that prints \"Hello World!\" to the console:\n\n```\npublic class HelloWorld {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Print \"Hello World!\" to the console\n        System.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program defines a class called `HelloWorld` with a static `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point of the program, and `public static void main(String[] args)` is the required signature for any main method in Java.\n\nIn this program's main method, the `System.out.println()` method is used to print \"Hello World!\" to the console. The `println` method automatically adds a newline character to the end of the string, so \"Hello World!\" will be printed on its own line.\n\nTo run this program, save the code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`, and then compile and run it using the following commands:\n\n```\njavac HelloWorld.java\njava HelloWorld\n```\n\nThe first command will compile the program, creating a `HelloWorld.class` file in the same directory. The second command will run the program, which should print \"Hello, World!\" to the console."},{"Context":"C#","Prompt":"Hello World Example","Response":"To print \"Hello, World!\" in C#, use the following code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass HelloWorld {\n    static void Main() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code includes the `System` namespace and defines a class called `HelloWorld`. It has a `Main` method that uses the `Console.WriteLine` method to print the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console."},{"Context":"node","Prompt":"Hello World Example","Response":"Here is an example of a Hello World program in Node.js:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\n```\n\nThis program simply prints out the message \"Hello World!\" to the console when it is run.

It then imports the `fmt` package, which contains functions for formatting and printing output.\n\nIn the `main` function, we use the `Println` function from the `fmt` package to print the string \"Hello, World!\" to the terminal.
